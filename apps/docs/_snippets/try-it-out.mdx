<Step  title="Try it out">

Go to https://unkey.dev/app and create a new key. Then verify it with our new server:

```bash
curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:3000/protected' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <KEY>"
```

It should return `"Your API key is valid!"` and log more information about the key, depending on what you set up in the dashboard.
